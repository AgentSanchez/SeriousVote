    #//There are two kinds of rewards set and random. Set rewards will run a command and nothing else
    #//these commands are run every time a vote is had. Random Rewards are chosen well..Randomly.
    #//
    #//        "12", "reward2", "say Reward2",  --All Random reward Lines should look like this
    #//
    #//  First Entry is a "percentage" the numbers should be an integer between 1 and 100, but if it's
    #//       Going to be a 100 might as well just set it as a set command. Note that the percentage
    #//       Dictates what "Loot Table" the reward goes to internally, multiple of the same percentage is fine,
    #//       They will simply share a loot table. It is recommended to keep the total value of all the
    #//       percentage values added up to 100 (Duplicate values are ignored in the sum since, items share
    #//       loot Tables).
    #//  Second Entry is the name of the reward, this name gets added to the {rewards} variable. Items in the same
    #//       loot table cannot have the same name!!.
    #//  Third Entry is the command you want to be run. You are free to use the {player} variable in there.
    #//
    #//This should be pretty straight forward. Number,Name,Reward. If you have any questions ask me on the forum.
    #//I am happy to help!



//#Each Reward Requires an id "which is the descriptor / identifier such as tomahawk: in the tomahawk reward
//# After each Reward requires a name key, and a reward key
//# The value for name is just a text String (This can be used to Call it out in the broadcast built in)
//#The value for the rewards string is a list of strings. Each String should be a full command and can include the standard variables
//# Each new command string needs a comma before it. If your command requires quotations make sure to add escape characters
//#-----i.e ----"hello how "are" you"---- is not valid the string should be escaped as follows
//#         ----"hello how \"are\" you---- The backslash allows the " to be escaped to be ignored by the parser
//#
//# Every single Reward should have it's id be unique, i.e there should not be more than one tomahawk ect... The name of the items can
//# be duplicated though, so a tomahawk1, and a tomahawk2, can have "Steel Tomahawk" as the name"
