***Why not go anywhere else?***

This is the best nuVotifier listener you'll ever use. Players not online? No problem, it will rack up their votes until next time they join, and don't worry it won't spam the public chat 50 times. NuVotifier also runs it's listener Async to make it compatible with BungeeCord. I've implemented a work around so commands are run from the main thread. If that wasn't enough,  cut the silence and motivate your players to vote by setting up the milestone rewards! Like dailies but for your addicting heroine-like server, How could Blizzard ever compete with you? Even better you can make your own **Custom** milestones, want to make a record for 3,20,17 votes you can do that! Want to make one for 1337 votes, you can do that too!

The whole Loot system has been reworked to introduce the new extremely flexible Loot Tables and table sets. These allow you to have the reward system choose from multiple sets of rewards allowing you to both re-use some rewards and organize and separate how you use them. Even better you can now for normal votes run more than one command.
